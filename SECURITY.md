## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of **LinkedIn Post Analyzer** seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Standard Reporting

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Please initiate a report by creating a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/contact/security-advisory) or emailing the maintainers directly at `security@example.com` (replace with your actual email).

You should verify that the issue is a security vulnerability, and not a bug or feature request, which should be reported in our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/tahsinmert/postlytic/issues).

### Information to Include

*   A detailed description of the vulnerability.
*   Steps to reproduce the issue.
*   Potential impact.
*   Any proof-of-concept code or screenshots.

### Timeline

*   We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
*   We aim to provide a fix or workaround within 14 days.
*   Public disclosure will occur only after the fix has been verified and released.

Thank you for helping keep our project safe!
